# Paper cups

We 💖 coffee. We are the kind of family who has a commercial-grade espresso machine and grinder in the kitchen and gets excited when a bag of fresh beans comes home, or when [@killermuffin](https://twitter.com/killermuffin) roasts a small batch at home with her Gene Cafe.

I also enjoy the graphics aspects of the coffee culture. I realized that my photo library was full of pictures of cute coffee paper cups after each trip to a new city. I started copying coffee paper cups as a non-creative exercise. I just wanted to have an excuse to draw when I was too tired to find inspiration.

I started posting them to Instagram, but I thought that I could find a better home for them here :)
